## Usage

FIXME

## Notes / Todos

- Update camper schema to hold a list of instrument preferences
- Incorporate matched bandmates into band's score
- Logic for valid band: bare minimum is drums & one other instrument
- Camper info entered into Salesforce
  - Name, age, instrument could be exported and serve as input to OkCampKid
  - On day of camp, have campers enter in their bandmate prefs
